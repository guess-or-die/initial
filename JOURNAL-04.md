Right away some steps to getting this completed were clear and present and also right away other steps were and are like crazy not coming to view.  Without much time investment, I could see how to create an array source file with as many words as I wanted, and then using an app.js choose a word at random and if needed gather the .length metrics.  It's at this point that I wasted toooooo much time trying to force the length to go somewhere and for some reason I was nervous to use a for loop thinking I could call other functions instead to pass on information to the browser about what I have (number of letters) and just give me the necessary spaces.  That was a fail. 

I remembered an ackward part of our lecture from 102318 where we took the word phrase  "Hiddy Hoe" and broke it into the sum of it's letters using a for loop.  On the console log, each letter is iterated regardless of length and nothing truncates or is omited.  This is great and I was able to connect that up to the working app.js without fail so at this point after a little too much digression the app can:
+ grab at random from an infinite list of words
+splice the word into the sum of it's letters
+display in the console.log

However there is a wall I have reached and if I just had that one thing that I need to know to move on, it'd be just super!

+ While the console log iterates each letter in the loop, my output function to the browser is only showing the last letter if I output with respect [j] and any letter indicies if I toss in a number [0]=first letter, [1]=second letter, etc.  
+ And yes that sucks, but it might prove an alternate approach if I decide to making matches between the user entry and the referenced word. Or maybe that's just the next rabbit hole lurching to take me away for a couple hours.
